“We have done this assignment completely on our own. We have not copied it, nor have
we given my solution to anyone else. We understand that if we are involved in plagiarism
or cheating we will have to sign an official form that we have cheated and that this form
will be stored in my official university record. We also understand that we will receive a
grade of 0 for the involved assignment and our grade will be reduced by one level (e.g.,
from A to B) for my our offense, and that we will receive a grade of “F” for the course
for any additional offense of any kind.”

Distribution of work:

Developing code: everybody

Running docker locally: Dillon

Creating visuals: Anna and Adi

Writing report: everybody

Running the code on the VM:

sudo docker-compose up --build

As of right now, there is an issue with the docker deployment between the postgres database connecting with each of the crawlers.
We have tried hours upon hours of troubleshooting, with no success as of yet.
We are able to run locally with no issue as well as on the VM, but not while the crawlers are running continuously
within a container.
